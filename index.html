            <p>
                Hello! My name is Ana Rocha, and I am a student at the University of Washington pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have a passion for technology and love exploring new advancements in the field. I enjoy mixing <strong>software</strong> and <em>human-centered ideas</em>. Lately I've been interested in projects that help students stay organized and supported. In my free time, I enjoy coding, hiking, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. This website serves as a platform to share my projects, interests, and culinary adventures with you. Thank you for visiting!
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing I'm proud of: I keep learning even when something is confusing at first. I enjoy the challenge of figuring things out and improving my skills over time.
            </p>
