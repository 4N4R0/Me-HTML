Personal HTML Website
Project Overview
In this project, I created a small personal website using only HTML in order to become more familiar with core HTML elements and proper document structure. The goal was not visual styling or interactivity, but rather to explore the breadth of HTML tags and how they work together to form a complete, valid website.
The site focuses on introducing myself and sharing a few things that interest me, while meeting all the technical requirements of the assignment.

What I Was Trying to Accomplish
The main objective of this exercise was to:

Practice writing semantic, valid HTML
Become comfortable using a wide variety of HTML elements
Build a small, multi-page website that is correctly linked and accessible
Validate my pages using an official HTML validator
This project helped me better understand how structure, semantics, and correctness matter even before any styling or scripting is added.

Site Content & Structure

The site's content is personal and intentionally kept tasteful and simple.
I describe myself and share what interests me, such as my academic focus and motivations.
The website consists of multiple pages, all connected through navigation links so that a visitor can easily move between them.

Pages Included

index.html — main page (“About Me”)
interests.html — interests and additional content
recipe.html - a brigadeiro recipe

The main entry point of the site is index.html, as required.

HTML Requirements
To meet the assignment criteria, I ensured that:

The website contains at least 30 unique HTML elements across all pages
Only HTML is used — no CSS and no JavaScript
Semantic elements (such as header, nav, main, section, article, footer, etc.) are used where appropriate
All links between pages work correctly
The instructor’s element-counting program confirms that the requirement for unique HTML elements has been met.

Validation

Each webpage was validated using the W3C HTML Validator:

https://validator.w3.org/

I verified that my HTML files are error-free.

Deployment

The site is deployed publicly so it can be accessed through a browser, as required.
I used a platform discussed in class (such as GitHub Pages or Netlify) to deploy the site.

Notes
This project intentionally avoids any styling or scripting. The focus is entirely on HTML structure, semantics, and correctness.
While the site is visually simple, it is structurally complete and standards-compliant.
This assignment reinforced the importance of writing clean, valid HTML and helped me appreciate how much structure and meaning HTML alone can provide. It also made me more confident in validating my work and preparing projects for deployment.
