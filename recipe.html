        <h2>Brigadeiro</h2>
        <p>Brigadeiro is a traditional Brazilian sweet treat made from condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles. It's a popular dessert at parties and celebrations in Brazil.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Chocolate sprinkles (for rolling)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>

            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent sticking, until the mixture thickens and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, grease your hands with a little butter and roll the mixture into small balls (about 1 inch in diameter).</li>
            <li>Roll each ball in chocolate sprinkles until fully coated.</li>
            <li>Place the brigadeiros in paper cupcake liners for serving.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow them to firm up.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your delicious brigadeiros!</p>
